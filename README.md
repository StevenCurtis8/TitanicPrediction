# TitanicPrediction
Predicts the survivability of Titanic passengers using three different Machine Learning models, Logistic Regression, The Perceptron and K-Nearest Neighbour. 

K-Nearest Neighbour was found to have the highest accuracy of correct prediciton (84%) and so a fourth method where K-Nearest Neighbour was built from scratch was created.

The training data originally has 891 observations and testing data has 418 observations. Both contain the following variables, “PassengerId”, “Pclass”, “Name”, “Sex”, “Age”, “SibSp”, “Parch”, “Ticket”, “Fare”, “Cabin” and “Embarked”. Additional information can be found in the Report.
