# TitanicPrediction
Predicts the survivability of Titanic passengers using three different Machine Learning models, Logistic Regression, The Perceptron and K-Nearest Neighbour. 

K-Nearest Neighbour was found to have the highest accuracy of correct prediciton (84%) and so a fourth method where K-Nearest Neighbour was built from scratch was created.
